How many blocks do you see over there? For us, we see three blocks. But we know geometrically that there is one more block behind them. 

If we don't ignore the laws of physics, there is a block that connects the three blocks. We at **3blocks** think of that invisible block as technology, and we are a team that researches and reaches out to the products, markets, and customers we encounter every day. Of course, underneath it all is technical expertise and understanding, just like our BI.

At 3blocks, we're at the forefront of AI research, focusing on the critical intersection of human literacy and AI interaction.

Our work in DX(AX) and HAI(HCI) is redefining how humans and AI systems collaborate. We're not just developing AI; we're researching and educating on the nuances of human-AI interaction, enhancing digital literacy, and preparing society for an AI-integrated future.

Our innovations in local and embedding models are making AI more accessible and efficient. This technology allows us to study and improve how people interact with AI systems, fostering a deeper understanding of both human and artificial intelligence.

Collaborations with industry main player like [Naver Connect](https://connect.or.kr/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Korea Expressway Corporation](https://www.ex.co.kr/eng/) have validated our approach and enabled real-world research on AI literacy and interaction. Additionally, we provide AI strategy consulting for public enterprises and local governments, helping them develop comprehensive AI roadmaps and policies.

At 3blocks, we're committed to bridging the gap between AI capabilities and human understanding. Our goal is to empower individuals and organizations with the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in an AI-enhanced world.

We invite you to join us in this crucial work. Together, we can shape a future where humans and AI coexist and collaborate effectively, driving innovation across all sectors.

We look forward to potentially working with you to advance the field of AI literacy and interaction.

Sincerely,
The 3blocks Team
